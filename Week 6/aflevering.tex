\section{UDP ping implementation}
The class \texttt{PingClient} has been implemented in the following file, \texttt{PingClient.java}:

\lstinputlisting[language=java]{PingClient.java}

A socket is opened in the \texttt{PingClient.run()} method in line 43. In line
44, we set the \texttt{receive()} timeout to 1000 milliseconds.

A ping request packet is formed in lines 53-55 and it is sent in line 59. Then,
we prepare an object in which the ping response is stored (lines 64-65), and we
wait for a server response in lines 66-74. If the server doesn't respond,
\texttt{receive()} wakes up and throws a \texttt{SocketTimeoutException}, which
we catch and handle in line 71. Otherwise, we calculate the time taken and
print out the size of the received packet in lines 68-69.

\subsection{Program output}

Launching a \texttt{PingServer} on the machine named \texttt{camel15}, port
8085, and launching a \texttt{PingClient} on the machine named
\texttt{camel08}, specifying destination hostname \texttt{camel15} and
destination port 8085, we get the following output:

\end{lstlisting}
The first four packets from the client get the appropriate attention from the
server, and for the fifth packet, the server simulates packet loss by
disregarding the request.
